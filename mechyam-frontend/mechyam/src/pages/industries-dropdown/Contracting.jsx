           These services include turnkey projects, new construction, interior fit-outs, site improvements and renovations. On occasion, a general contractor even takes over a project that’s already underway. It includes taking up a project from conception to completion, handing it in its entirety from the ground up. These turnkey projects are increasingly popular in new construction. We deliver certain renovations on a turnkey basis.
